           <p>Students try to guess the hidden word by guessing one letter at a time.
           If students guess correctly, the letter will be revealed and no lives are lost.
           If student guess incorrectly, they will loose a life.
           If all lives are lost, the word will be revealed, including missed leters</p>

           <h1>Settings</h1>
           <p>On the settings page, the teacher can add a list of words to the game, one of which will be chosen at random at the beginning and when the 'new game' button is pressed. You can also decide how many 'lives' to give your group and what these 'lives' are. For examples, these could be students' favourite characters, or they could be 'prizes' for the group such as no homework. One life is taken away for each incorrectly guessed letter.</p>
